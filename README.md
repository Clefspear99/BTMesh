A personal project I'm currently working on (pretty early stage.) This is an android app that aims to connect multiple devices together in a Bluetooth Mesh 
Network. One device broadcasts a message to all the devices it's connected to which then proliferates the message to all the devices they are connected to. Eventual
goals included using encryption for sending private messages to individuals or groups. I may copy an interface from an open source chat app.
